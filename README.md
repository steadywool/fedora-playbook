## 🚀 Installation

> ⛔ **Important variables are present in the `ansible/host_vars` directory. You need to edit them to customize your installation.**

Firstly, install Ansible:
```
# dnf install ansible
```

You can then clone this repository and enter it:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/steadywool/ansible-dotfiles
$ cd ansible-dotfiles
```

Start the playbook and configure your system with this command:
```
$ ansible-playbook ansible/playbook.yml -K
```

> ⛔ **If you run the playbook with the `root` user, your user configuration will be installed under the root account.**

## 📕 Exemples

Install every packages & enable/start Systemd services:
```
$ ansible-playbook playbook.yml -K -t packages,services
```

> 📌 **The `-K` option is used to request the "sudo" password. We need it for tasks requiring privileges.**

Executes tasks requiring no privileges:
```
$ ansible-playbook playbook.yml -t USER
```

Execute the entire playbook but skip the "dotfiles" role:
```
$ ansible-playbook playbook.yml -K --skip-tags dotfiles
```

For more arguments, check the man page with the command `man ansible-playbook`.
